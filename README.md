# 📊 Customer Segmentation Using RFM Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project performs **customer segmentation using RFM (Recency, Frequency, Monetary) analysis** on an e-commerce transaction dataset.
The objective is to understand customer purchasing behavior and segment customers into meaningful groups that can support **customer retention**, **targeted marketing**, and **revenue optimization strategies**.

The project focuses not only on applying RFM scoring, but also on **clean data handling**, **accurate metric calculation**, and **business-oriented interpretation of results**.

## 🎯 Business Objective

* Identify **high-value and loyal customers**
* Detect **customers at risk of churn**
* Understand **customer distribution across segments**
* Enable **segment-based marketing and retention strategies**

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts Used

* RFM Analysis (Recency, Frequency, Monetary)
* Customer Segmentation
* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
* Data Cleaning & Validation
* Business Interpretation of Data

---

## 🛠️ Tools & Libraries

* **Python**
* **Pandas** – data manipulation and aggregation
* **NumPy** – numerical operations
* **Matplotlib & Seaborn** – data visualization
* **Scikit-learn** – scaling support (future clustering extension)

## 📂 Dataset Description

* **Type**: E-commerce transactional data (CSV)
* **Key Columns Used**:

  * `CustomerID`
  * `InvoiceNo`
  * `InvoiceDate`
  * `Quantity`
  * `UnitPrice`

Each row represents a product-level transaction for a customer.

## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preparation

To ensure accurate RFM analysis, the following steps were applied:

1. **Removed missing CustomerID values**

   * Prevents incorrect customer aggregation and distorted RFM scores

2. **Removed invalid transactions**

   * Quantity ≤ 0 (returns or cancellations)
   * UnitPrice ≤ 0 (free items or incorrect pricing)

3. **Handled date consistency**

   * Converted `InvoiceDate` to proper datetime format
   * Removed rows with invalid or missing invoice dates

4. **Created TotalAmount**

   * `TotalAmount = Quantity × UnitPrice`

These steps ensure that only **valid, completed purchase transactions** are included in the analysis.

## 📐 RFM Metric Calculation

RFM metrics were calculated at the **customer level**:

* **Recency**:
  Number of days since the customer’s most recent purchase (based on the latest invoice date in the dataset)

* **Frequency**:
  Number of unique invoices generated by the customer

* **Monetary**:
  Total spending by the customer across all transactions

---

## 🔢 RFM Scoring Methodology

* Each RFM metric was divided into **5 quantiles (scores 1–5)**.
* Scoring logic:

  * **Lower Recency → Higher Score**
  * **Higher Frequency → Higher Score**
  * **Higher Monetary → Higher Score**

### RFM Score & Segment Creation

* Individual R, F, and M scores were combined into:

  * `RFM_Segment` (e.g., 555, 432)
  * `RFM_Score` (sum of R, F, and M scores)

## 🧩 Customer Segmentation Logic

| RFM Score Range | Customer Segment    |
| --------------- | ------------------- |
| ≥ 12            | Best Customers      |
| 9 – 11          | Loyal Customers     |
| 6 – 8           | Potential Customers |
| 4 – 5           | Customers At Risk   |
| < 4             | Lost Customers      |

## 📊 Results & Key Insights

### Customer Distribution by Segment

| Customer Segment    | Customer Count | Percentage (%) |
| ------------------- | -------------- | -------------- |
| Potential Customers | 899            | 30.00%         |
| Best Customers      | 823            | 27.46%         |
| Loyal Customers     | 736            | 24.56%         |
| Customers At Risk   | 467            | 15.58%         |
| Lost Customers      | 72             | 2.40%          |

**Total Customers:** ~2,997

---

### 🔍 Key Insights

* **82% of customers** fall into Potential, Best, and Loyal segments, indicating a **strong and active customer base**.
* **Potential Customers (30%)** form the largest segment, representing a strong opportunity for upselling and increased engagement.
* **Best and Loyal Customers (52%)** together form the core revenue-generating customer group.
* **Customers At Risk (15.58%)** show declining engagement and are ideal targets for retention campaigns.
* **Lost Customers (2.4%)** represent a small portion, suggesting controlled churn.

---

## 💡 Business Implications

* Retention strategies should prioritize **Best and Loyal Customers** through rewards and loyalty programs.
* **Potential Customers** should be nurtured with personalized offers to increase frequency.
* **Customers At Risk** should receive re-engagement campaigns to prevent churn.
* Marketing spend can be optimized by **segment-specific targeting** instead of uniform campaigns.
